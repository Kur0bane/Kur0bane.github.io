        <h4>When creating our python project, we had trouble creating the correct code required to actually activate and print our mathimatical equation to subtract the stones from the pile. We discovered the method of using the global keyword which my teammate used to fix the problem in the code by using it to call the global variable. After we solved our first issue, we had to put the function inside of a function to meet the requirements for the assignment. We were able to accomplish this by creating a new function calledd subtract which we placed the function for the base code into. The part of the project that I did myself was implementing the function inside of a function. I created the subtract function which I placed the old function into and reorganized it to make it work again.</h4>
